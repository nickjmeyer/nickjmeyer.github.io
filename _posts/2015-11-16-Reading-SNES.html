title: Reading a SNES controller using Arduinos
categories: Arduinos
---

<p>
Last winter, I hacked a Pogoplug V4 with <a href="http://blog.qnology.com/2014/07/hacking-pogoplug-v4-series-4-and-mobile.html">this</a> tutorial and installed
Arch Linux ARM.  The Pogoplug is a very cheap and inexpensive way to
set up a home server.  I highly recommend it if your server needs are
aren't too complex.  With this server, I set up a NFS to house all my
media.  I run XBMC on an Amazon Fire TV and mount the NFS.  It
works great.  One night, I was laying in bed and decided that using
the factory remote for the Fire TV was boring.  So, I decided I should
make my own.
</p>

<p>
For this post, I'm going to focus on setting up the wireless
communcation between the Arduinos.  Ultimately, I will put the boards
into a SNES controller, but for that I need to learn to solder.  In
addition, the power draw of the micro is too high to make a sufficient
remote.  I will need to use a "barebones Arduino" to obtain this
efficiency.  The latter parts will come in other posts.

Since this was my first crack at electrical engineering, I decided
the first thing to do was order a SNES controller online and open it
up (I didn't want to use my own for the first round).  The inside is
quite simple.  Each button is attached to a conductive pad that
shorts a circuit when the button is pressed.

The controller has a parallel-in serial-out shift register that the
console uses to read the button inputs.  The shift register sends the
input from one button at a time and the console has the ability to
cycle which button it is reading.  All I had to do was connect an
Arduino to the shift register and read the input just as if the
Arduino was a SNES console.  Arduino has a great <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftIn">tutorial</a> on reading
multiple button inputs using shift registers.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I had no hardware or hands-on knowledge of how to
complete this project.  I spent a lot of time reading about shift
registers and watching Youtube tutorials before I bought any tools.
Once I felt like I knew the path I needed to take, I started with
learning the basics of programming Arduinos.

To begin, I picked up a <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit">starter kit</a> and followed some of the
tutorials.  The book that comes with the kit does a great job of
walking you through some basic programs.  Besides the nice
tutorials, another benefit to the starter kit is the plethera of
parts that comes with it.  If you're like me, and know little about
building circuits, it is nice to have all the parts (resistors,
LEDs, capacitors, etc.) that come with the kit and not have to worry
about finding them on your own.

There are many different Arduino boards.  Inside the starter kit was
an Arduino Uno.  This is a commonly used board, but this board was
not going to work for my purposes.  For this project, I needed
something that could act as a USB keyboard.  The choices were the
Arduino Micro, Leonardo, or Due.  I decided to use the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMicro">Arduino Micro</a>
due to the small size.

Below is the SNES controller pinout.  Note that the "strobe" is also
referred to as the "latch".I cut the cord to the SNES controller and
attached the wires to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_wire">jumper wires</a> to use on a breadboard.

Here is a table showing which pins on the Arduino to connect to each
wire on the controller.

When reading the button inputs, the button order is in the following
table.

The code for reading the buttons is <a href="https://github.com/nickjmeyer/nesModding/blob/master/nesInput/nesInput.ino">here</a>.  In order to compile the
code you need to install the <a href="http://maniacbug.github.io/RF24/">RF24</a> library following <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">this</a> guide.
</p>

<p>
Here is a video showing the controller and the corresponding output.

Now that we can read the buttons from the controller, the next step
is to convert those to keyboard inputs.  Then we can use a second
Arduino and set up wireless communication.  Finally we will make the
remote power efficient enough to run off of a battery.  These will
come in later posts so check back later.

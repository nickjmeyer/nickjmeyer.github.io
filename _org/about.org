* Hi!
  I'm Nick Meyer.  Currently, I am in graduate school at North
  Carolina State University studying statistics.  I grew up in
  Michigan in a suburb of Detroit and moved to Raleigh in 2012 for
  graduate school.  For undergrad, I studied at the University of
  Michigan where my highest priority was attending the football games.
  Go Blue!!!

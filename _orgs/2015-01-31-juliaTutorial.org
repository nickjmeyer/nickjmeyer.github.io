Declaring variables
#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both :session :cache yes
  x = 8;
  x
  show(x)
#+end_src


Arithmetic
#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both :cache yes
  x = 8
  y = 7
  print(x)
  print(y)
  print(x+y)
#+end_src

Wait, what happened here?  The output of x,y,x+y is mashed together.
How to fix this?

#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both :cache yes
  x = 8
  y = 7
  print(x,"\n")
  print(y,"\n")
  print(x+y,"\n")
#+end_src

While it may be someone cumbersome to type the newline character "\n"
everytime, this setup helps keep your output customizable.


Lets, define our own class.  This class will be based on modular arithmetic.

#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both :cache yes
  type ModType{n}
      x::Int
      ModeType(x::Int) = new(mod(x,n))
  end

  x=ModType{2}(6)
  print(x)
#+end_src


#+begin_src julia :results output :exports both :cache yes
  print(1:5,"\n")
  print([i for i=1:5],"\n")
  print([trace(rand(n,n)) for n=1:5],"\n")
#+end_src

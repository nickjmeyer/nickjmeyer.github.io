I'm Nick Meyer.  Currently, I am in graduate school at North
Carolina State University studying statistics.  I grew up in
Michigan in a suburb of Detroit and moved to Raleigh in 2012 for
graduate school.  For undergrad, I studied at the University of
Michigan where my highest priority was attending the football games.
Go Blue!!!
